Answer each of the following questions by editing this file. Your instructor has provided sample responses-- you should replace them. When you are finished, your instructor will guide you through the process of committing work to a new branch and creating a pull request (PR).

## 1. Which programming language will you be studying for this course?

I will be studying PHP.

## 2. Find at least one implementation of that language to use for the class. In other words, install a set of tools so that you can write and execute programs in your language in our class meetings. Describe it here.

I am using a text editor (notepad++) for the writing of HTML and PHP and running the code on a WAMP server locally.

## 3. Identify information sources for learning more about your language: Web sites, books, etc. List them here.
