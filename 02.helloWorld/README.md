# Hello, world!

Put the file(s) containing the source code for your "Hello, world!" program in this folder, using your working branch.

In the space below, explain the process of creating and running a program with your language and preferred toolset.

When you have finished, commit to your working branch and create a pull request (PR).

**1. Are your toolset(s) IDEs or "old school"?**

My toolsets are more 'old school' as the tools are just a text editor and a WAMP server

**2. Are your language implementation(s) translation, interpretation, or hybrid?**

PHP's language implementation is interpretation.

**3. What is the environment that you are programming? For example, are you writing native applications for an operating system? Are you embedded in a game engine, Web browser, Web server, database server, ....?**

I am programming on the server side of a Web server most of the time. Thus far, I have used an HTML page to send a POST request to the server to get access to the PHP and then the browser displays the page. If the PHP were just echoing some words on the same page, the environment would be embedded in a web browser.
