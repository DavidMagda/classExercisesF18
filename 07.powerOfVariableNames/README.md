# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.

C++ is case-sensitive so Uppercase Letters and Lower Case letters are different
The name of identifier cannot begin with a digit. However, Underscore can be used as first character while declaring the identifier.
Only alphabetic characters, digits and underscore (_) are permitted in C++ language for declaring identifier.
Other special characters are not allowed for naming a variable / identifier
Keywords cannot be used as Identifier.

## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?

camel case 

## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 
### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.

no it will not allowed it.
