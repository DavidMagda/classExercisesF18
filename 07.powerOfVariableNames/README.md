# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.

contains alphabetical characters, decimal digits, and the underscore character.
## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?
Ruby unfortunately doesn’t have a cohesive style guide like python’s PEP-8, but there is a community driven reference guide on github with an attempt at such a guide. This includes using snake case for variables and methods and camel case for classes and objects, not separating numerical identifiers from variables/objects with an underscore, i.e //working_sys1 = good
working_sys_2 = bad//

## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 
### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
No the words are reserved and will not execute if you try to run the code.
