# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.

there cannot be a space between multiple words in a variable

A variable cannot begin with an integer, and can only contain alphanumeric characters

the length of the variable name does not matter- so 'x' would be fine

You can use camelCase or AlternateCase, ALLCAPS

## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?

Classes and Interfaces: MyClass, MyInterface
Methods: myMethod() {

You should tailor your identifiers to something relatable to what its purpose is, you should avoid one character variables

common temp variable names are: i,j,k,m, and n for integers.. and c,d,e are used for characters or strings. 


## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 

no

### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
