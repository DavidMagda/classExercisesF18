# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.
The first character of the identifier must be a letter of the alphabet
The rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (upper or lowercase), underscores ('_') or digits (0-9).
Identifier names are case-sensitive.

## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?
There are 10 of them :
-General
-Packages
-Modules
-Classes
-Global (module-level) Variables
-Instance Variables
-Methods
-Method Arguments
-Functions
-Constants

## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 
### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
No it wont let me write because there are bunch of reserved words in Python such as 'and' , 'def', 'if' ...
