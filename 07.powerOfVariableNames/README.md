# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.
In Ruby identifiers are case sensitive so Cat & cat are 2 different variables if in a program. Identifiers may consist of alphanumeric characters and the underscore character ( _ ).

## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?
Typically snake_case is used most often within Ruby, although camelCase is used for classes.

## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 
### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
Not that I am aware of. Ruby reserves most special words that typically you would expect to be reserved. The only thing that jumps out to me would be print. print isn't used to output a value on to the screen as instead Ruby uses puts or prints.
