# Chapter 11: The Power of Variable Names

## 1. Describe the rules for valid identifiers in your PL.

* Identifiers can be of any length and can consist of letters, numbers and underscores.


 * They cannot begin with a number.
* They are case sensitive
* Variables can have the same name as functions
* Variables must start with a sigil ($)

## 2. What naming convention(s) are typically used with your PL?

* Constants are all ALL_CAPS
* The first letter of *every* word is UppercaseForClasses.
* camelCase for methods and properties
* Functions have lower_case/snake_case
* Variables have $snake_case also.

## 3. Will your language allow you to write things like the Coding Horror on page 287? 

No. PHP has a list of reserved words that would not allow for this program to be written.

### If so, show a code sample. Most PLs will not, because the special words that have predefined meanings in the PL are **reserved words**-- programmers cannot use them as identifiers.
