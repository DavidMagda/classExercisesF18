**1. Explain any setup that was needed to make your program run.**

i needed to import a scanner tool made by java.
I needed to declare a variable that stored whatever i input via keyboard into the system that was being scanned by the scanner (i linked the variable to the scanner)
i wrote a system output code that displayed whatever information was stored in the variable that the scanner was reading, onto the screen.
2 varaibles were used, one for name and one for age, but only one scanner was needed to read them both.
