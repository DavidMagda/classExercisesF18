# Unusual Datatypes

We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.

structures: you can import different utilities in java, create classes, explicitly declare variables, define your methods, program starts at main, and then you have your different blocks of statements.

Java uses both data structure and object oriented programming.  It is best to keep varaibles that do something and exist for a use inside an object, and variables that are just to store properties and data inside a data structure.  Then you can create a seperate object to connect the two, without them having to depend on each others code. (seperate classes and methods) 

## 2. Your PL's support for reference or pointer types.

Java uses references to point to objects inside of functions. (only one object at a time) References are strongly typed in Java. Users cannot access or modify pointers in java, they are only used by java to point to references.

## 3. Your PL's features related to global data and/or access routines.

java does not allow for global variables because everything must be contained in classes, but you can declare a variable to be static to be used by the whole class which in a sense is global, for that class at least. So you would have to write your whole program as one class for there to be global variables.
