# Unusual Datatypes

We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.
In C, the 'struct' keyword is necessary, and no functions can be declared inside the structure. Only pointers can be used for structs, references aren't a thing in C. Also, C is a language built without OOP support, but there are ways around it that I haven't fully explored yet.

## 2. Your PL's support for reference or pointer types.
References are not a feature of C, but pointers are. Pointers can be used to store and manage the addresses of dynamically allocated memory blocks.. Pointers can be used for any data type

## 3. Your PL's features related to global data and/or access routines.
C allows the user to define global variables.
