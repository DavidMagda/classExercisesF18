We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.

Perl strong suit is data. Perl has a large variety of tools used in different ways. Some tools being Hash tables, arrays, and blocks.
