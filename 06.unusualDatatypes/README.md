# Unusual Datatypes

We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.
Pthyon supports structures such as lists, loops, sets, classes, etc. Python does support object-oriented concepts.

## 2. Your PL's support for reference or pointer types.
Python language referencing describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.

## 3. Your PL's features related to global data and/or access routines.
Python supports all global statements and access routines.
