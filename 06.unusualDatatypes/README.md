# Unusual Datatypes

We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.
Ruby allows for arrays, hashes, & iteration.

## 2. Your PL's support for reference or pointer types.
In Ruby almost all variables are is a reference or pointer to a object. 
It should be noted however you can not do pointer arithmetic as in C.

## 3. Your PL's features related to global data and/or access routines.
Global variables are supported in Ruby but strongly discouraged.
