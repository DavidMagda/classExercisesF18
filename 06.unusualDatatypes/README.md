# Unusual Datatypes

We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.
Data structures help you to focus on the bigger picture rather than getting lost in the details.  Python has four primitive variable types which are Integers, Float, Strings,Boolean.
Also Python is a great programming language that supports OOP. It's a dynamic language, with high-level data types. It does not require the programmer to declare types of variables and arguments.

## 2. Your PL's support for reference or pointer types.
Variables in python are automatically pointers. The equal “=” assignment operator automatically creates a pointer 

## 3. Your PL's features related to global data and/or access routines.
