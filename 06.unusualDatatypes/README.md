# Unusual Datatypes

We will be exploring memory management and pointer issues in class using some C code that you will find in this folder.

In the spaces below, describe the following.

## 1. Your PL's support for structures or records. Also, your PL's support for object-oriented concepts, a related idea which we will explore later on.

PHP allows heterogeneous data to be put into arrays. PHP also has support for object oriented concepts similar to Java.

## 2. Your PL's support for reference or pointer types.

PHP allows for references whixh are aliases so two different variables to be written to the same value.

## 3. Your PL's features related to global data and/or access routines.

PHP has global variables and also puts all global variables into an arrays which can be accessed instead of writing the varisble name.
