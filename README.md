# CSCI 201 Class Exercises

All students will submit work on in-class exercises using this single repository. Each student will commit to their own working branch, submit a pull request (PR), and present the PR's contents in class.

In a bash terminal (such as c9), you can create and checkout (activate) a working branch with this command: `git checkout -b <BRANCHNAME>` where `<BRANCHAME>` is a placeholder for a new branch name that you choose. Choose a name that indicates what programming language you are using, and your initials or username. For example: `git checkout -b mattinglyJS`.

Sometimes you will be asked to sumbit answers to questions in a Markdown file. Markdown is a file format that is designed to support rich formatting while also being easy for people to write and to read in raw form. You can read more about GitHub's flavor of Markdown [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).
